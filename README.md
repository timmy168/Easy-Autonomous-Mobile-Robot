# Easy-Autonomous-Mobile-Robot
## About
This small project is about design and applications of mobile robots. The project build a mobile robot with a simple mobile base, battery, wheels, DC motors, touch sensors, light sensor, and control with RasberryPi and Arduino board. The topics include DC motor and motion control, robotic sensors and interfacing, robot locomotion and behavior-based programming. 
## Checkpoints
Each checkpoints contains a code of ROS catkin package and a Arduino code, the code is compile at Linux Ubuntu 20.04
