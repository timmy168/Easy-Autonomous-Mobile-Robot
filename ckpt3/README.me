# Purpose
The primary goal of this checkpoint is to meticulously configure the sensors on the mobile robot's base. This setup empowers the robot with the ability to detect collisions with obstacles and perceive ambient light through touch sensors and light sensors. Following this configuration, the robot is poised to accomplish a straightforward missionâ€”locating a light ball. The mission involves initiating contact with an obstacle, subsequently relying on the sensors to identify the presence of light and ultimately pinpointing the target object.

# Design
For the sake of convenience in testing and debugging, this checkpoint focuses solely on implementing the Arduino board. It is important to note that this work does not involve any communication with the Raspberry Pi using ROS. The Arduino code is specifically designed to detect collisions with touch sensors, directly connecting to Arduino pins with analog input. The same approach is taken for the light sensor.

Upon collision detection, the robot initiates a rotation for a predetermined duration, approximately 5 seconds. During this rotation, if the robot identifies a light value surpassing a predefined threshold, it pauses and assumes control to capture the target. In the absence of a detected target during the rotation time, the robot pauses momentarily and proceeds to move straight ahead until it encounters a new obstacle. The process then recommences, repeating the aforementioned sequence.

The touch sensor located at the base's bottom plays a crucial role in mission completion. Once this touch sensor makes contact with the ball, signaling the successful completion of the mission, the robot comes to a halt.
