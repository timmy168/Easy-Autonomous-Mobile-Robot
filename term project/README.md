# Narrow Space Explorer
## Introduction
Autonomous mobile robots have become integral in various missions and tasks, typically operating in spacious or well-lighted environments. However, there exists a significant challenge when these robots navigate through narrow spaces, such as pipelines or alleys, where traditional navigation methods face limitations, particularly in low-light conditions.

## Objective
The primary objective of this term project is to design and implement a small-scale autonomous mobile robot capable of effectively traversing in narrow and potentially low-light environments, this will be achieved by integrating advanced sensors, such as ultrasonic or radar sensors, to enhance the robotâ€™s perception and navigation capabilities. The proposed project addresses a practical need in the field such as inspecting pipelines, exploring tight industrial spaces, or conducting search and rescue operations in areas inaccessible to humans such as post-fire disaster site.

Incorporate ultrasonic sensors to enhance the robot's ability to detect and navigate through narrow spaces by dividing surrounding into couple parts such as front, right, left and so one, then utilized the sensor to detect the surrounding to determine the direction of the robot. The sensor will provide real-time data to the robot's control system, enabling adaptive and efficient navigation.
