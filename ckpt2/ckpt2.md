# Purpose
The purpose of this checkpoint is to ensure the precise setup of the motor on the mobile robot's base. This setup enables users to remotely control the robot via SSH, sending PWM analog signals to the motor. This functionality allows for various motor control actions, including moving forward, backward, turning left and right, and traversing a straight path with ease.

# Design
This checkpoint encompasses two key tasks: 
(1) Motor Setup: The first task involves the precise installation of the LN298 motor on the mobile robot's base, ensuring that it is securely and correctly positioned. 
(2) Remote Control and PWM Signaling: The second task focuses on enabling remote control of the RosberryPi via SSH. This control mechanism involves sending PWM analog signals to the Arduino board, which, in turn, translates these signals into motor control actions.
